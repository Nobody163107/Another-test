Git is a version control system which contains the tools to track the changes in your code

Git helps in tracking the history of the code in chronology, and also allows collaborative work

Github is a website where developers can push their code through git. 

when changes are final, we commit the changges, so we first add the changes -> then we commit those changes

once we initialised the git, you can configure your account using the commands 
// git config --global.uername "username"
// git config --global.email "email"
you can check your details using 
// git config --list

whenever we work on any project we clone the repository (a repository is nothing but a folder)
to do that we copy  the https the link and then use the git clone command 
git clone <url>
we can also use the cd command to change directory, clear command clears the terminal and ls gives the list of the files in the repository
ls -a prints the names of the files including the hidden files

modified -> the added file has a change which is not commited yet
untracked -> the file has not been added yet
staged -> ready to commit
unmodified - > unchanged

git add <file name> to add the file, if you want to add all files git add . 
you can commit and add some message using git commit -m "the message"

the original repo which we cloned is known as origin

you need to come out of the directory you enter cd ..
